    <p>If you're seeing this, you're savvy enough to know how to inspect our HTML and Javascript. 
      If you spend any length of time looking it over, you may find ways to hijack our intended 
      user experience and data collection. This is, of course, partly our fault for quickly building 
      an app without complex security methods. Even so, we ask you to PLEASE FILL OUT OUR SURVEY AS 
      INTENDED. Every step of the survey was built with a purpose for our hypothesis. We would have 
      loved to make our security stronger and our survey more elaborate, but it's only a small part 
      of our comps. So we're relying on your good faith to ensure accurate data collection. We really 
      appreciate it. If you have suggestions or notice flaws in our design, please, email them to 
      Nathaniel Reid at reidn@carleton.edu. Thanks; now, back to typing!</p>

    <h4 id="text-round-9"></h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-10">Now that you're comfortable with the system, and we have no more to say, let's share a fun anecdote.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-11">In most Software Development projects, "debugging" is a common task.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-12">"Bugs" are the little, annoying problems that aren't too hard to fix, but always multiply furiously.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-13">The term "debugging" is popularly attributed to U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-14">Admiral Hopper was working in Harvard University on a Mark II computer in the 1940s.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-15">A moth became stuck in one of the archaic machine's large relays, and was damaging its functionality.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-16">As she helped remove the moth, Admiral Hopper commented that they were "debugging" the machine.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-17">However, this common myth is likely wrong; "debugging" was used in papers and media even in the 19th century.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-18">It was commonly used in aeronautics engineering prior to the devleopment of computers.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-19">But even Thomas Edison mentioned it in his writings, in the 1870s. </h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-20">It might have emerged from very early mechanical engineering jargon.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-21">Before circuitry and machines were miniaturized, real bugs could cause problems if they crept into machines.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-22">But we don't know for sure when the word originated.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-23">Rear Admiral Grace Hopper was an incredible engineer, though.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-24">She earned a PhD in mathematics from Yale. She tried to join the Navy during World War II, but was rejected due not meeting physical requirements.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-25">She instead joined the Navy Reserves and went through basic training before helping the Navy work on computers that were used in the Manhatten Project.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-26">After the war, Admiral Hopper continued advancing computer science, working on the famous UNIVAC computer.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-27">She developed one of the first compilers, a piece of software that we computer scientists love.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-28">If we couldn't compile code, we couldn't write it in actual words and symbols. We'd need to use numbers.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-29">It'd be bad. </h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-30">So thank you, Admiral Hopper. You may not have originated a fun C.S. term, but you did save us all a lot of work.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-31"></h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-32">Failure. Keep trying different typing rhythms until one works.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-33">Failure. We can't offer you hints for the purposes of the study; 
      that's why we limited this to ten attempts.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-34">Success! We'll move to another password composition.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-35">Failure. Try again!</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-36">Failure. Try again!</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-37">Failure. Try again!</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-38">Success! Continue trying to crack passwords until you get to forty inputs. </h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-39">Success! Good work.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-40">Failure! Try again.</h4>

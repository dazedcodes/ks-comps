    <h4 id="text-round-10">Now that you're comfortable with the system, and we have no more to say, let's share a fun anecdote.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-11">In most Software Development projects, "debugging" is a common task.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-12">"Bugs" are the little, annoying problems that aren't too hard to fix, but always multiply furiously.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-13">The term "debugging" is popularly attributed to U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-14">Admiral Hopper was working in Harvard University on a Mark II computer in the 1940s.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-15">A moth became stuck in one of the archaic machine's large relays, and was damaging its functionality.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-16">As she helped remove the moth, Admiral Hopper commented that they were "debugging" the machine.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-17">However, this common myth is likely wrong; "debugging" was used in papers and media even in the 19th century.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-18">It was commonly used in aeronautics engineering prior to the devleopment of computers.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-19">But even Thomas Edison mentioned it in his writings, in the 1870s. </h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-20">It might have emerged from very early mechanical engineering jargon.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-21">Before circuitry and machines were miniaturized, real bugs could cause problems if they crept into machines.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-22">But we don't know for sure when the word originated.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-23">Rear Admiral Grace Hopper was an incredible engineer, though.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-24">She earned a PhD in mathematics from Yale. She tried to join the Navy during World War II, but was rejected due not meeting physical requirements.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-25">She instead joined the Navy Reserves and went through basic training before helping the Navy work on computers that were used in the Manhatten Project.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-26">After the war, Admiral Hopper continued advancing computer science, working on the famous UNIVAC computer.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-27">She developed one of the first compilers, a piece of software that we computer scientists love.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-28">If we couldn't compile code, we couldn't write it in actual words and symbols. We'd need to use numbers.</h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-29">It'd be bad. </h4>
    <h4 id="text-round-30">So thank you, Admiral Hopper. You may not have originated a fun C.S. term, but you did save us all a lot of work.</h4>
